### Algorithm
***

A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user. As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on the recommendations, the engine becomes more and more accurate. The concepts of Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) are used in information retrieval and also content based filtering mechanisms (such as a content based recommender). They are used to determine the relative importance of a document / article / news item / movie etc.
Benefits:
* No data from other users is required to start making recommendations. 
* Recommendations are highly relevant to the user. 
* Recommendations are transparent to the user.
* You avoid the “cold start” problem. 



### Benefits
***
A recommendation system helps them increase their popularity among service providers as they help increase number of items sold, offer a diverse selection of items, increase user satisfaction, as well as user loyalty to the company, and they are very helpful in getting a better understanding of what the user wants.
